# Typescript Exercises - Social Tables Edition

## Caveat Emptor

1. I am not a typescript expert. You will be learning along with me and hopefully we'll all get there.

2. This is intended as a hands-on exercises.  Come ready to code!  It will be boring just watching and you won't get much out of it.

3. We'll start very basic and progress steadily to more advanced stuff.  The goal is that nobody gets left behind.

3. We should record any questions that can't immediately be answered and come back to them later with researched answers rather than hand-waving or guessing.

4. Feel free to give me feedback both negative and positive! This is a new style of presentation for me.

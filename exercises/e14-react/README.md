# React in Typescript - Part 1

We're going to run through the basics of writing React things in typescript.  For examples we'll be using some codesandbox containers which you can fork and work on.

Super-Contrived scenario:
Design has decided that our design system needs more "whhhhimsy" and have added Pusheen the Cat complete with color variations and animations. A developer has done the initial implementation in JS, but the decree has come down from your tyrannical engineering lead that all new components must be typescript and it needs to be converted.

Pusheen Component example (JS): https://codesandbox.io/s/gifted-http-sijrl
Pusheen Component example (TS): https://codesandbox.io/s/dry-sunset-3gh6w

## Exercises
--------
1. The app is already being compiled with the ts compiler.  Take a look at the tsconfig.json to refresh on that and see what else has changed.
2.  Convert the Title component to typescript following the guide at: 
https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/function_components
3. Convert the App component to typescript with usereducer guidance from: https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks
4. Look at the section on defaultProps together: https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/default_props
5. Look at the props articles together:
https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/basic_type_example
https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/react_prop_type_example
6. Convert the AnimationControls component to Typescript using https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/forms_and_events as help, specifically the event handling types
7. Briefly skim the Context, ref, Portals sections
8. Interesting technique mentioned in the Troubleshooting handbook: https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/troubleshooting/types#simulating-nominal-types

(We'll cover the Advanced section on this same site next time.)

# Type Declaration Files

Let's continue with the example from before, but make try to make the types resolve in a couple ways.

## Exercises
1. Convert `lib/myid.js` to typescript to appease the compiler.
2. Create a `shortid.d.ts` file in the `types` directory and add type declarations for shortid referencing the docs at https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid (starter code: `declare module 'shortid' {}`).  Note that this is for learning purposes.  We could alternatively get good type information by running `npm install @types/shortid`.

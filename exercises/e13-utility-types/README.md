# Utility Types

We don't have to build our own generics necessarily, typescript has some built-in utility types and the community has even more.

## Exercise
Address all the TODOs in the test files to make our tests typesafe.
1. Do TODOs in tests 1-4
2. Do TODOs in tests 5-8
3. Do TODOs in tests 9-12

# Tuples

An array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but don't have to be the same.

1. Look over the first test to get a basic example.
2. Satisfy the typechecker by creating a height1 variable that has a tuple of Sizes to represent how we commonly think about human height (e.g 6 ft. 1 in.), and make the test pass with a heightString function that creates a string with that representation from the two Sizes in the tuple.
